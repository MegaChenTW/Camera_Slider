## 04/24
    finish the prototype 3d model. start the coding project
### Short term Goals:
-   finish the communication between microcontroler & stepper driver

## 05/04
    redesign the "plate" 3d model.
    still working on the stepperdriver.h
    started working on the ui system, and it's painful
### Short term Goals: 
- finish the communication and the UI system
### Problems:
- warning : 
## 05/28
    busy coding and forget to record the devlog. That's a bad habit
    Have to finetune the 3d model. It looks terrible now.
    StepperDriver.h and Menu.h are *probably* finished (which means I will not change anything significantly)
    We'll have a presentation tomorrow,but one of the motor driver board couldn't calibrate. I check the connection and do some debugging but it's not working. The UART part wroks, so something is wrong with the motor phase line power suppply mosfet. Sadly, most function of that driver board are only activated after calibration.
    FUCK!
    Why it broke just before the presentation!!!!!!
### Short term Goals: 
- make a better 3d model
### Problems:
- replace the god damn broken driver
